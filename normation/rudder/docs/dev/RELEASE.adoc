== Release
This documentation refers to the creation of a release. 

=== Build
To create a release, you must first specify the version number of your release to generate.
To do this, you must modify the `VERSION` file. You must enter the desired version number.

Specify the desired version number as follows:
----
echo "1.0.0" > normation/rudder/VERSION
----

Once this is done, you can start the build of the release.
To launch the build:

----
make release # or
make build-plugin
----

The built plugin can be found in `normation/rudder/build`.

=== Clean all
To clean up all generated releases, you can use the command :
----
make clean-builds
----
This command will delete all previously generated builds.
